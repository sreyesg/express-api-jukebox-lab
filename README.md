# Jukebox Back-end Lab
Welcome to the Reactville Jukebox! In this lab, you’ll build the backend of a collaborative, community-driven jukebox application where anyone can contribute tunes by adding, updating, or deleting music tracks. This lab is designed to give you practice developing a backend API using Express.

As you develop each feature, you should use Postman to test your API endpoints.

You’ll implement full CRUD operations, allowing users to interact freely with the music database. Let’s dive in and make Reactville a bit more musical!
